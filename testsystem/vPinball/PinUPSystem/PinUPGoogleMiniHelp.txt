***************************************************************************************************************
**** NOTE:   starting in OCT/2020 IFFT doens't allow more than 3 applets for free.  So i've modified PoPPER Voice to use only ONE ifft action"

when following the video you only need to setup ONE applet like this:

Process:  {"data":[{"action":"process","what":"{{TextField}}"}]}

then in config of pinupgooglehome.exe you setup your phrases for the different popper actions...
****************************************************************************************************************


the following still work if you are on a paid subscription and wish to continue using old methods.

Volume:  {"data":[{"action":"volume","what":"{{NumberField}}"}]}

GameFind:  {"data":[{"action":"find","what":"{{TextField}}"}]}

PlayList:  {"data":[{"action":"list","what":"{{TextField}}"}]}

Function:  {"data":[{"action":"do","what":"{{TextField}}"}]}

(optional) Run :  {"data":[{"action":"run","what":"{{TextField}}"}]}

configure/run:  PinUPGoogleHome.exe   (must put in windows startup batch as well)...

supported statements:

Volume with #.  set to 0 to mute.  (could setup another IFFT to hardcode mute in data)

Find "gamename"     (better to use 'part' of name (star not "star wars" and not plural because its a 'contains' search)

PlayList "listname"  (better to use 'part' and not plural because its a 'contains' search)

Function "xxxx" supported:
	launch
	system
	home
	exit
	quit
	record
	restart
	shutdown
	info
	menu (brings up operator menu)
	help
    lockdown (playonly mode)
	special (will launch inGame batch/script)
	custom (will run customvoice.bat in same folder of exe)
