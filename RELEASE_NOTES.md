## Hotfix

### Bugfixes

- Fixed Studio update issues: Both of the installer .exe files did not set any privileges. So when installed in the **program folder** of Windows, the update did only work when the program was started as administrator. I've never noticed because I did use another folder all the time.
- Fixed Table Uploads: The table versions have been resetted on upload + replace which should not be the case.
- Fixed **Virtual Pinball Spreadsheet** url which points to the new beta version now.
