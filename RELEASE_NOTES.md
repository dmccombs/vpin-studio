- Added Remote File Editor: It's a first very basic text editor, but as a first step, you can edit the **DmdDevice.ini** and the **VPMAlias.txt** now remotely. (The editor can't do much since text editing with Java is like driving Formula 1 with a Fiat Panda).

### Bugfixes

- Fixed Studio update issues: Both of the installer .exe files did not set any privileges. So when installed in the **program folder** of Windows, the update did only work when the program was started as administrator. I've never noticed because I did use another folder all the time.
