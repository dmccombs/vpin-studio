## Hotfix

- **Fixed System Manager**: Added automatic resolving if the downloaded archive contains a root folder that must be skipped during extraction. This affects the latest FlexDMD release 1.9.1 that was not extracted correctly.
- **Table Replacement/Cloning**: The field **DateFileUpdated** is now updated when a table is replaced or cloned.
