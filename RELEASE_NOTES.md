## Release Notes

### Changes

- DOF Preferences: Added second DOF installation folder for people using 32-bit and 64-bit installations in parallel.
- DOF Preferences: Added option to let the VPin Studio server synchronize DOF settings.
- System Manager: Added Serum support. Since the newer Serum .dll files are not necessarily part of Freezy anymore, they can be downloaded this way now too.
- Pause Menu: Added preferences checkbox for the tutorials, so that you can skip the rendering of YouTube entries completely (in case you have downloaded all tutorial videos instead).

### Bugfixes

- Enabled folder selection for VPin Studio installer files.
- Enabled dashboard support for rotated playfields: With long overdue, this should finally work for those of you using rotated playfield screens. I've only supported the default portrait mode of Windows here, no additional rotations.
