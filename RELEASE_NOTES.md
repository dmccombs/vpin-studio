## Release Notes

### Changes

### Bugfixes

- Table Upload Dialog: Fixed radio checkboxes in the table upload dialog so that the full text can be clicked now.
- Highscore Card Settings: Fixed a critical error that when the highscore card settings invoked a "no content" error was shown (a follow up error from migrating the card settings from a properties file to the database). 
- Overlay and Highscore Card Overlay: The cursor is hidden now when overlays are shown.
