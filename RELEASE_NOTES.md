## Release Notes

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed broken highscore parsing (again): Sorry, I really messed up this one. I disabled the the PINemHi editor for now as it corrupts the _pinemhi.ini_ through a different type of comments.
- Improved error handling for videos with alpha channels: Unfortunately, these can't be played, but a better message is shown now.
- Improved size of window's drag handler.


In case you used the PINemHi editor:
- Download the PINemHi program.
- Copy the original _pinemhi.ini_ file into the _resources/pinemhi/_ folder of the VPin server. (Keep your credentials!)
- Restart the server.
