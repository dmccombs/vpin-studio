## Release Notes

### Changes

- Added DOF Preferences: You can synchronize your DOF settings via API key now. Note that this synchronization is not performed during the server startup, but only added for convenience in the preferences.
- Enabled Remote VPX Installations in the "System Manager": Since a VPX update does not need any additional steps, the installer button is now enabled also when the Studio client has a remote connection to the server.

### Bugfixes

- Improved VPX emulator lookup from Popper database (there may have been issues when the VPX emulator was renamed).

### Known Issues

- There are still some updater/installer issues not tackled yet. More about this in future updates.
- ROM Aliases: the logic/UI for the alias stuff is too confusing and needs an overhaul.
