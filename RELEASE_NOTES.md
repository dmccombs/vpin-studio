## Release Notes 2.21.2
 

### Bugfixes

- **VPin Studio Launcher**: Improved error handling so that the Studio still launches on seven-zip issues.
- **Competitions / TournamentId**: The id that is generated for the Popper field "Tournament Id" contains now the information segment **remote/local** to indicate if the the user is the competition owner or not. E.g. when you subscribed to another ones table subscription, the value will be **remote**. You can use the keywords to build custom SQL playlists with these keywords.
