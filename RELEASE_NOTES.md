## Release Notes


### Changes

**Added New "System Manager" Section**

Added main navigation item "System Manager". You can use the System Manager to check if your VPin software stack is up-to-date.
The integrated installation simulator allows you to check if how on update would look like.
The System Manager uses the latest Github releases from various projects and compares these against your local files.
Note that there is always the possibility that the released artifacts of these projects may change in an unexpected way.
