## Release Notes

### Changes

- Moved "Analytics" section into "Tables" section tab "Table Statistics". The view doesn't have to be this prominent, that's why it has been moved.
- Added copy buttons for VPS table URLs (needed later on).

### Bugfixes

- Fixed drag and drop of media assets ...again.
- Fixed empty table view when a broken VPX file was scanned.
