## Release Notes

### Pause Menu Added

I'm happy to announce the brand-new "Pause Menu" for Popper/VPX has been released. The menu item are created using the existing assets from the "help" and "info" folder of PinUP Popper.
Additionally, a summary is shown, together with the highscore card generated by the VPin Studio server.

Also, the **Virtual-Pinball-Spreadsheet team** threw in the new section **tutorials** and filled the sheet with a lot of YouTube videos already.
These videos are automatically available in the pause menu for the corresponding tables.

The "Pause" menu can be configured in the preferences section "Overlay & Pause Menu" (former "Overlay").
