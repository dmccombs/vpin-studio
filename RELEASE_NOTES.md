## Hotfix


### Bugfixes

- Fixed DMD uploads (finally): The last hotfix did lowercase the target folder and ignored subfolders. Both issues have been fixed.
- Disabled auto-apply of VPS data to the Popper database. The action must be separated from the "auto-fix" action for finding the matching VPS table. The impact is not obvious.
- Fixed possible error for some backglasses preventing them from being uploaded.
- Fixed missing "local" check for the VPSaveEdit button in the highscores section.
