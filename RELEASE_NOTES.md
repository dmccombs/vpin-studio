**Table Management**

**Competitions: Table Subscription**

The competitions section has a new tab now: "Table Subscriptions".
These combine the best of both worlds: offline competitions and Discord competitions.
Table subscriptions allow you to create a separate Discord channel for a table, depending on the ROM name of it.
New highscores will be posted there so you can always check your current score of all tables via Discord.
**Also** other players can subscribe to the channel. By doing this, their highscores will compete with yours.
