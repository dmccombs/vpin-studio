## Release Notes


### Changes

**PinUP Popper 1.5 Support**

- Added additional fields to the "PinUP Popper Table Settings" section. You can now configure all new PinUP Popper metadata fields there. The new fields are only shown if you already use version 1.5.
 

**Table Management: DMD**

- Added DMD section.

**PinUP Popper Table Settings**

- Added missing "custom2" and "custom3" fields.

**Table Management: ALT Color**

- Moved FlexDMD button to new DMD section.

**Table Subscription & Discord Competitions**

- Added "Synchronize All" button.
- Improved highscore sync: Instead of only synchronizing only the latest highscore of a table against a competition or subscription, the full highscore history is "replayed", starting the start-date of a competition or subscription. This way, untracked highscores are pushed into table subscription channels.
- 

### Bugfixes

- Fixed ignored "enabled" flag when highscores were fetched for generating highscore lists on the dashboard.

### Known Bugs

- Table sorting is still broken :/
