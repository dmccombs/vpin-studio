## Release Notes

### Changes

- Moved "Analytics" section into "Tables" section tab "Table Statistics". The view doesn't have to be this prominent, that's why it has been moved.
- Added copy buttons for VPS table URLs (needed later on).
- Colorized version update icons.
- Replaced transient VPS table update notification with a persisted state. The update indicator for this is a new column in the table overview. If you are not interested in these updates, you can hide the column in the UI preferences.
