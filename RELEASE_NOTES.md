## Release Notes

### Pause Menu Added

I'm happy to announce the brand-new **"Pause Menu" for Popper/VPX** has been released. The menu item are created using the existing assets from the "help", "other2" and "info" folders of PinUP Popper.
Additionally, a summary is shown, together with the highscore card generated by the VPin Studio server.

Also, the **Virtual-Pinball-Spreadsheet team** threw in the new section **tutorials** and filled the sheet with a lot of YouTube videos already!
These videos are automatically available in the pause menu for the corresponding tables.
People already picking up on this by producing compact and comprehensive instruction videos.

See for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wdMAUnDLsI&ab_channel=MichaelKongedam !

The "Pause" menu can be configured in the preferences section "Overlay & Pause Menu" (former "Overlay").

### New "VPS Tables" View

The tables section now has an additional view called "VPS Tables".
It shows you an overview of all existing VPX tables available on the virtual-pinball-spreadsheet.net and shows an indicator which ones you already have.
