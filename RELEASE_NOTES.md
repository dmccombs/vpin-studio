## Release Notes 2.17.0

### Changes

- **PrOPPER Naming**: Added PrOPPER Naming to the Table Data Manager dialog. I also restructured the dialog, added the **Score Data** into a separate tab and moved the VPS assigment to the first tab with the new PrOPPER Naming input fields.
- **Playlists**: Added **Favorites** and **Global Favorites** options to playlist section.  
- **Playlists**: Added **Favorites** icon to the **playlist column** in the table overview. The icon is shown if the table has been marked as favorite or global favorite on a playlist.
- **VPS Tables View**: Added list of all table versions to the VPS table details section.

### Bugfixes
