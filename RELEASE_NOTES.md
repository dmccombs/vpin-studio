## Release Notes

### Changes

- Added "Tutorials" to the virtual-pinball-spreadsheet change listener: While not visible in the Studio itself, this change type is now also emitted by the Discord bot if used.
- Added "Pause" menu: The menu can be configured in the preferences section "Overlay & Pause Menu" (former "Overlay").

### Bugfixes

- Fixed overlay focus issue for VPX GL: Added repetitive focusing so that the overlay will appear for Visual Pinball X GL version too.
