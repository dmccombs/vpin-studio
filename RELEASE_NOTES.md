## Release Notes 2.17.0

### Changes

- **PrOPPER Naming**: Added PrOPPER Naming to the Table Data Manager dialog. I also restructured the dialog, added the **Score Data** into a separate tab and moved the VPS assigment to the first tab with the new PrOPPER Naming input fields.
- **Playlists**: Added **Favorites** and **Global Favorites** options to playlist section.  
- **Table Overview**: Added **Favorites** icon to the playlist column if the table has been marked as favorite or global favorite an a playlist.  

### Bugfixes

- **Card Generator**: Fixed template assignment. Embarrassing, but the actual template assignment did never worked when the actual cards have been generated.
- **Card Generator**: Fixed padding setting whe used to determine the X position of the highscore. Note that this fix will affect your card design.
