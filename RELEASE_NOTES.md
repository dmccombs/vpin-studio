## Release Notes

### Pause Menu Added

I'm happy to announce the brand-new "Pause Menu" for Popper/VPX. The menu item are created using the existing assets from the "help" and "info" folder of PinUP Popper.
Additionally, a summary is shown, together with the highscore card generated by the VPin Studio server.

Also, the **Virtual-Pinball-Spreadsheet team** threw in the new section **tutorials** and filled the sheet with a lot of YouTube videos already.
These videos are automatically available in the pause menu for the corresponding tables.

The "Pause" menu can be configured in the preferences section "Overlay & Pause Menu" (former "Overlay").

### Changes

- Added "Download" button inside the asset manager dialog to download assets from your cabinet's Popper media folders to your local PC (might come in handy from time to time).
- Added "Tutorials" to the virtual-pinball-spreadsheet change listener: While not visible in the Studio itself, this change type is now also emitted by the Discord bot if used.
- Removed VPS update notifications from the user's Discord bot. Please follow the VPS-Bot channel instead.
- Added RAR support for uploads of: ALTSound packages, VPX files and PUP Packs.

### Bugfixes

- Fixed overlay focus issue for VPX GL: Added repetitive focusing so that the overlay will appear for Visual Pinball X GL version too.
