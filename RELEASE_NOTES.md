## Hotfix Notes

### Bugfixes

- **Fixed card generation (again)**: Fixed issue for the target filename of highscore cards.
- Increased delay of initial overlay show: There may be a timing issue when the overlay is visible earlier than the PinUP Popper menu and then gets hidden behind it.
- Fixed disabled "Install" button in the System Manager.
