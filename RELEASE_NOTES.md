## Release Notes


### Changes

**Highscore Preferences**

- Changed section "Score Format" to "Highscore Settings"
- Added allow list for highscores which filters the dashboard highscores by specific users. The filtering for Discord events will follow with the next regular update. 

### Bugfixes

- Disabled timeout for now, since there are some long requests which might easily exceed the default timeout.
