## Release Notes 2.21.2
 
- **Playlist**: With the help of @Ltek, the playlists have been fixed so that the usage of favorites and global favorites makes more sense. In addition to that, letter icons are rendered for the common default Popper playlists.

### Bugfixes

- **Installer**: Added .net check before server installation. Yes, this should be part of the installer, but this was the easier fix.
- **Univeral Uploader**: Fixed detection of DMD packages (containing a whitespace, e.g "Metal Slug.UltraDMD").
