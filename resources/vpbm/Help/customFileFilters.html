    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</span></h3>
    <img src="img/CustomFileFilters.jpg" alt="Custom file Filters" style="float: right;">
    <p>At times there will be games for which the default file filters do not pick up all associated emulator game content. This may occur because the game uses multiple ROMs (in VPX) or perhaps there are specific library files required for the game (Future Pinball).</p>
	<p>The <strong>Custom File Filters</strong> panel is designed to address this sort of situation by allowing users to add their own additional game specific filters directly targeting these missing files. These filters, once added are stored with the game, both in the backup file and in the Pinup System database.</p>
    <p><strong>Custom File Filters</strong> are only designed to work within the emulator directory structure, the base emulator directory for the selected game is shown in the <strong>Emulator Base Path</strong> text field.</p>
	<p>As custom file filters are modified, content in the Selected Game Content panel are immediately updated to reflect.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining a Filter</span></h3>
    <p><strong>Custom File Filters</strong> are made up of two elements, shown below:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Path</strong></dt>
        <dd>A path relative to <strong>Emulator Base Path</strong> to perform the filtering in. Wildcards (*) are not permitted in this path.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Filter</strong></dt>
        <dd>A filter to apply to the contents of <strong>Path</strong> to identify game content. A filter may match to a filename within <strong>Path</strong> or to a directory name. When a match is made to a directory, the directory and all its content is included as game content. Wildcards (*) may be included in this filter, however path separators (\) are not.</dd>
    </dl>
	<p>Both <strong>Path</strong> and <strong>Filter</strong> values may make use of <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> path variables, described below to represent parts of the path/filename. The calculated values of these variables is displayed in the bottom of the <strong>Custom File Filters Panel</strong></p>
	<p>In the example image the calculated values are <strong>007 Goldeneye (Sega 1996) VPinWorkshop 1.0 MOD VR</strong> for [GAMENAME] and <strong>gldneye</strong> for [GAMECODE]. The [GAMECODE] value is used in the second example filter to look for a directory inside the <strong>VPinMAME\artwork</strong> directory matching the [GAMECODE] value so would look for files or directories called <strong>gldneye</strong>.</p>
	<br/>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Path Variables</span></h3>
    <p><strong>Custom File Filters</strong> will often make use of common game values representing the games filename, or the game name itself (often its <strong>ROM</strong> name in VPX). To save the user having to manual enter these values, two variables are provided that can be included in either the <strong>Path</strong> or <strong>File Filter</strong> values. The calculated values of these variables is displayed at the bottom of the panel to indicate what the variables will be substituted with. These variables are:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>[GAMENAME]</strong></dt>
        <dd>Instances of the text "[GAMENAME]" in the <strong>Path</strong> or <strong>File Filter</strong> values will be replaced by the corresponding text value. This represents the filename of the game (minus extension).</dd>
        <dt><strong>[GAMECODE]</strong></dt>
        <dd>Instances of the text "[GAMECODE]" in the <strong>Path</strong> or <strong>File Filter</strong> values will be replaced by the corresponding text value. This value represents the internal game name (<strong>cGameName</strong> in VPX and sometimes <strong>cPuPPack</strong> in Future Pinball) of the game. If no value is found the game script this value will be blank.</dd>
    </dl>
    <hr>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing Custom File Filters</span></h3>
    <p>Three buttons are provided to allow users to <strong>Create</strong> new, <strong>Update</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong>
    existing custom filters. These buttons will become available when they are valid to use.</p>
	<p>Once defined custom file filters will be considered along with the default file filters for the games emulator and influence which files are considered part of the game.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Making Custom File Filters Global</span></h3>
    <p>Should it be determined that a custom filter should be applied to all games for the current emulator, then the filter should be added globally via the <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> configuration file, as described in <a href="./applicationSettings.html">Application Settings</a>.</p>
