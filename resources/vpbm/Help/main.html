    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Virtual Pinball Backup Manager</span></h3>
    <img src="img/vpbmFullScreen.jpg" alt="VPBM" style="float: right;">
    <p>Virtual Pinball Backup Manager  (<span class="vpbm">VPBM</span>) processes a variety of game content including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Game scripts/files</li>
        <li>Backglass files, POV files, ROM and NVRAM files as well as alt colour/sound files (VPX)</li>
        <li>Game libraries required by game scripts (Future Pinball)</li>
        <li>Game specific Pinup Player Pup Packs</li>
        <li>Game specific Pinup Popper front end media files</li>
        <li>Copies of all stored game database settings</li>
        <li>Copies of any game specific registry settings (VPX)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The contents of a games backup can easily be viewed within the application using the tree view, while an integrated <strong>Quick View</strong> bar provides users a quick visual indication of the presence of critical files - as shown in the screenshot provided. Additionally, a <strong>Pinup View</strong> displays Pinup media, in a manner consistent with how media is displayed within Pinup Menu Setup.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> is not designed to replace Pinup System, in fact it depends on it to function - rather it tries to add features that make managing game files and settings easier. I found myself storing all files used by a game in a backup folder and then having to manually copy these files when I felt the need to update my system, <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> automates this process.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> has been designed to quickly highlight to users when a games backup has fallen out of synch with the currently installed version of the game, allowing users to use the functions provides to address the inconsistencies.</p>
    <p><span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> backup files are encrypted and locked to the machine that they were created on, however a mechanism is provided to export games to a known external system. For infromation on this feature, refer to the <strong>Export Path</strong> and <strong>Export Host Identifier</strong> settings described at <a href="./applicationSettings.html">Application Settings</a>. This process does not a llow games to be exported and shared universally.</p>
    <p>Integrated help is provided, with the various menus and application panels making up the application each having their own help buttons. Quick links to this help is provided below.</p>
