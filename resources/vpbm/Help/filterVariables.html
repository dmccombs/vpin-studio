    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</span></h3>
    <img src="img/filterVariables.jpg" alt="Custom file Filters" style="float: right;">
	<p></p>
    <p><strong>File Filters</strong> make use of common game values representing items such as the games filename, or the game name itself (often its <strong>ROM</strong> name in VPX), or associated text files. To save the user having to manual enter these values, a series of variables are provided that can be included in either the <strong>Path</strong> or <strong>File Filter</strong> values on the <a href="./customFileFilters.html">Custom File Filters</a> panel.</p> 
	<p>Because these variables are extracted from game scripts, and game scripts are completely freeform, at times it is not possible to automatically extract values. The <strong>Filter Variables Panel</strong> addresses this issue by providing a facility to allow some filter variables to be manually overridden.</p>
	<p>This panel serves two purposes - to display the current extracted values of various variables and provide context to users modifying custom file filters, and to allow users to override specific variables when appropriate.</p>
	<p>When modifying custom file filters, double clicking on a variable label (such as <strong>[GAMENAME]</strong>) will copy the text and allow it to be pasted into filter text fields.</p>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Filter Variable Summary</span></h3>
    <p>Not all filter variables can be edited by the user (for instance <strong>[GAMENAME]</strong>). Additionally, some variables are only valid for specific emulators. Only filter variables valid for the currently selected games emulator are displayed.</p>
	<p>Not all games contain all filter variables. When no evidence can be found in game scripts of a variable being required, it is greyed out in the <strong>File Variables</strong> panel. An example of this is <strong>[VPREGCODE]</strong> in the provided image. Even when a variable is greyed out, should the user detect that it is required, an override can still be applied by ticking the associated checkbox.</p>
    <p>A summary of available filter variables is provided below:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>[GAMENAME]</strong> - (All emulators)</dt>
        <dd>This value is taken straight from the Pinup System database. As such it cannot be overridden, as this a fundamental element of how Pinup System works. This will usually be the game filename minus the file extension.</dd>
        <dt><strong>[GAMECODE]</strong> - (All emulators)</dt>
        <dd>This value is used by Pinup System as the name of the Pup Pack associated with a table.<br/>
		In VPX, this value corresponds to the value of <strong>cGameName</strong>. For VPX games that use a ROM this will also be the name of the ROM, unless an alias has been defined in <strong>VPinMAME\VPMAlias.txt</strong>. This value is used to identify content such as altcolor and altsound folders and NVRAM entries.<br/>
		In Future Pinball the value corresponds to the value of <strong>cPuPPack</strong>.</dd>
        <dt><strong>[REALROM]</strong> - (VPX)</dt>
        <dd>This value is used only by VPX. The file <strong>VPinMAME\VPMAlias.txt</strong> is used to map <strong>cGameName</strong> values to aliased ROM files. This caters for cases where a single ROM is used for multiple games, however each game requires different related data (ie Pup Packs, altcolor/altsound folders). This value is automatically calculated based on content of <strong>VPinMAME\VPMAlias.txt</strong> so cannot be overridden.<br/>
		In the (usual) case where no <strong>VPinMAME\VPMAlias.txt</strong> entry exists, the value will match the value of <strong>[GAMECODE]</strong>. ROM searches will always use this value.</dd>
        <dt><strong>[VPREGCODE]</strong> - (VPX)</dt>
        <dd>Some VPX games make use of the <strong>User\VPReg.stg</strong> file. This file is a Microsoft compound file which allows games to store blocks of storage (often high scores or game settings) in a block of storage identified by a key string. The value of the key string is set by a call within the table script to the <strong>SaveValue</strong> function.<br/>
		It is expected that this variable will not be required for user entered filters as VPReg filters are already setup by default.</dd>
        <dt><strong>[NVRAMOFFSET]</strong> - (VPX)</dt>
        <dd>Some VPX games share ROMS and hence <strong>cGameName</strong> values. As such they would usually share the same NVRAM file. This is not always desired - think of the case where the same table has multiple versions, high scores and settings for one version may not be wanted to be shared by other versions. To avoid this, users are able to call the function <strong>NVOffset</strong> which allows a unique value to be specified for a particular table instance. In practice VPX when loading a game with an <strong>NVOffset</strong> copies in a new version of NVRAM which it stores with a name that makes use of the value passed to the <strong>NVOffset</strong> function.<br/>
		It is expected that this variable will not be required for user entered filters as NVRAM Offset filters are already setup by default.</dd>
        <dt><strong>[USERTXT]</strong> - (VPX)</dt>
        <dd>This filter captures cases where VPX tables load custom text files and parse values out of these. In the script, this will be identified by a call to <strong>createTextFile</strong> and almost always use the <strong>User</strong> directory.<br/>
		While this variable is not expected to be used for custom filters as the default filter already consider it, however it is possible that multiple custom user text files could be used, in which case custom filters may be required.</dd>
    </dl>

	<h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overriding Filter Variables</span></h3>
	<p>Functionality is provided to allow users to modify the value used for several variables. This would usually be done to correct parsing errors or populate values that couldnt be extracted.</p>
	<p>Variables that can be overridden have a checkbox available to mark them as being overridden. When initially enabling an override, the value used for the override matches the current extracted value. Users are then able to modify the value in the text field.</p>
	<p>Color coding is used to highlight missing expected values (red) and values that need to be committed (yellow) by pressing the <strong>Update</strong> button.</p>
	<p>Color coding is used to highlight missing expected values (red) and values that need to be committed (yellow) by pressing the <strong>Update</strong> button.</p>
	<p>In the provided screenshot, the value for <strong>[GAMECODE]</strong> is being overridden but the value is yet to be committed.</p>
