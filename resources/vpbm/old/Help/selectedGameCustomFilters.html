    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</span></h3>
    <p>At times there will be games for which the default <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> filters do not pick up all associated emulator game content. This may occur for numerous reasons, such as scripts being written in a way that variables cant be extracted or games being written to make use of additional data files.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Selected Game Custom Filters</strong> panel is designed to address this sort of situation by allowing users to add their own additional game specific filters directly targeting these missing files. These filters, once added are stored with the game, both in the backup file and in the Pinup System database.</p>
    <p><strong>Selected Game Custom Filters</strong> are only designed to work within the emulator directory structure corresponding to the given games emulator.</p>
	<p>As custom filters are modified, other panels are immediately updated to reflect the changes.</p>

    <br />

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Defining a Filter</span></h3>
    <p><strong>Custom Filters</strong> are made up of two elements, shown below:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Path</strong></dt>
        <dd>A path relative to <strong>Emulator Base Path</strong> to perform the filtering in. Wildcards (*) are not permitted in this path.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Filter</strong></dt>
        <dd>A filter to apply to the contents of <strong>Path</strong> to identify game content. A filter may match to a filename within <strong>Path</strong> or to a directory name. When a match is made to a directory, the directory and all its content is included as game content. Wildcards (*) may be included in this filter, however path separators (\) are not.</dd>
    </dl>
	<p>Both <strong>Path</strong> and <strong>Filter</strong> values may make use of <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> path variables, described below to represent parts of the path/filename. The calculated values of these variables is displayed in the <strong>Selected Game Filter Variables Panel</strong>.</p>
	<br/>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing Custom File Filters</span></h3>
    <p>Three buttons are provided to allow users to <strong>Create</strong> new, <strong>Update</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong>
    existing custom filters. These buttons will become available when they are valid to use.</p>
	<p>Once defined custom file filters will be considered along with the default file filters for the games emulator and influence which files are considered part of the game.</p>
    <p>The example below shows a new custom filter being added to <strong>Fish Tales (Williams 1992) JLouLoulou 0.5</strong> to add an extra data file to the Tables directory. Other panels are immedialtely updated after the filter is added.</p>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Making Custom File Filters Global</span></h3>
    <p>Should it be determined that a custom filter should be applied to all games for the current emulator, then the filter should be added globally via the <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> configuration file, as described in <a href="./applicationSettings.html">Application Settings</a>.</p>
