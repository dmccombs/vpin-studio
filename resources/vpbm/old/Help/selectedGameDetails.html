    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</span></h3>
    <p>The <strong>Selected Game Details</strong> panel provides a read only view of the currently selected games details. This information mirrors the information found within the Pinup Popper Games Manager, but is a read only copy of this information.</p>
    <p>Users wishing to modify game data seen in this panel should do this through Pinup Popper as the scope of <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> is limited to the management of game backups rather than editing game data.</p>
    <p>The source of information viewed in this panel is determined by the selections made in the <a href="./selectedGameDisplayControl.html">Selected Game Display Control</a> panel.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If <strong>Disk</strong> is selected, the displayed content is taken from the currently active Pinup Popper database.</li>
        <li>If <strong>Backup</strong> is selected, the displayed content is taken from the currently games backup file.</li>
    </ol>
