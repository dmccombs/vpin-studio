    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</span></h3>
    <p>The <strong>Selected Game Content</strong> panel provides a read only view of game files and related content that make up a game and its settings. This content includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>All emulator defined game files, as dictated by configured gamer filters. Examples includes game/table files, as well as B2S and POV files, VPinMAME ROM, and alt colour/sound files or BAM game config files.</li>
        <li>Any Pup Pack content for the game from within the Pinup System PupVideo directory.</li>
        <li>Any Pinup Popper frontend game media files found in the Pinup System POPMedia directory structure.</li>
        <li>For emulators that make use of registry settings to store game information, a set of registry values used by the game.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As mentioned above, this information is read only and allows users to see what values have been found (when viewing current game content) or what values have been stored in the backup file (when viewing backup game content).</p>
    <p>The source of information viewed in this panel is determined by the selections made in the <a href="./selectedGameDisplayControl.html">Selected Game Display Control</a> panel.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If <strong>Disk</strong> is selected, the displayed content is taken from the currently active Pinup Popper database.</li>
        <li>If <strong>Backup</strong> is selected, the displayed content is taken from the currently games backup file.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are two components that make up this panel, these are listed here and described in further detail below.</p>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick View Status Strip</span></h3>
    <p>The Quick View Status Strip is shown as a strip of traffic light coloured rectangles across the top of the <strong>Selected Game Content</strong></p>
    panel.</p>
	<p>This status strip provides a very quick to view indication of the presence or not of key game files. The makeup of the status panels shown in this strip will vary by emulator and is driven by emulator configuration. The colour of each status panel in the strip provides an indication of the game files status, the colours are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A red status panel indicates the corresponding file is marked as mandatory and was not found. Failure to supply this file will result in the game not running or being significantly limited.</li>
        <li>A green status panel indicates that the file was found.</li>
        <li>A yellow status panel indicates the file was not found, however the file is not marked as mandatory.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hovering the mouse over a status panel will provide a description of the file it represents, and for files that were found, will provide the file name for quick reference.</p>
    <p>For files that were found a single click will expand the tree view below to navigate to the file that has been clicked on.</p>
    <br />
    <hr>

    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree View</span></h3>
    <p>The Tree View is the large "Windows Explorer" like control that dominates the <strong>Selected Game Content</strong></p>
    panel.</p>
	<p>The tree view provides a complete tree-view representation of all content found for the game. Depending in what game content has been found, the tree-view may have 3 base nodes representing:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The game emulator - containing all game emulator specific files</li>
        <li>Pinup system - containing Pup Pack content and POP media files that were found</li>
        <li>Registry settings - containing details of game specific registry settings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Expanding the tree and navigating to a file item will show the full path to the file on either the file system (when <strong>Current</strong> is selected in the <a href="./selectedGameDisplayControl.html">Selected Game Display Control</a> panel) or within the backup file. Double clicking on a file entry will attempt to open the file using the default Windows application associated with the file.</p>
    <p>Contents of the registry node (if present) provides a quick way of viewing current registry settings for the game.</p>
