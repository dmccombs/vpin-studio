# VPin Studio

The VPin Studio is a util to manage VPin users, tables, competitions and highscores.
It depends on PinUP Popper and gives the user an overview about installed tables
and their media configuration.

## Installation

Download the latest installer from the [releases section](https://github.com/syd711/vpin-studio/releases). 

In general, the VPin Studio has a client/server architecture,
supporting the configuration of multiple VPins with one client.
That's why every release comes with two different installers:
- **Full Installer**: this installer must always be installed on the actual VPin and contains the server and the client UI.
- **Client Installer**: this installer only contains the UI client which let's you connect from any other Windows PC to your VPin.
