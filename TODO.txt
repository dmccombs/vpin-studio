- add screen checkboxes to media manager
- fix duplicate message emitting
- scan highscores only after scanning games
- save table details with one update statement
- remote upate must update local client too
- vpin mame alias is broken

Also, the upload and replace; presently, it renames everything to the “new file name” - it be nice if there was a way to preserve the old file name.

For example, my old table is fathom (Bally 1981).vpx and I want to replace it with unclepaulies - which has a much longer file name with VR etc.

If I update in popper, I just drag the new file to the update button and it replaces my old table but keeps the name fathom (Bally 1981).
