- add screen checkboxes to media manager
- fix duplicate message emitting
- scan highscores only after scanning games



At the moment, from what I can tell, to update a table entry, I have to click at the top the little arrow icon.  Then select “upload and replace”

Then when that is done, I click the pancake icon at the top, go to details tab, change the version number, then click the info tab and update the url (if applicable)
That’s a good few steps.  In pinup popper all that information is available to change from the one screen/tab

I understand why you did it this way, because the upload screen allows you to also add new tables and isn’t just there for “updating”
Perhaps you’d consider a for when you “update and replace” it also facilitates you changing the Game Version number, the URL, and Author.

Those are the fields that usually are edited, at least for me, when I update a table entry.


Also, the upload and replace; presently, it renames everything to the “new file name” - it be nice if there was a way to preserve the old file name.

For example, my old table is fathom (Bally 1981).vpx and I want to replace it with unclepaulies - which has a much longer file name with VR etc.

If I update in popper, I just drag the new file to the update button and it replaces my old table but keeps the name fathom (Bally 1981).

And finally - when you update a table it’s not updating the “last file update” part in popper.  This will impact “recently updated” playlists


Under Virtual Pinball spreadsheet, I like you have sorted the tables in date order
could you make some table formation to separate them a little
